# Sudoku solver.

On the wonderful Computerphile channel a video was posted about a Python programme to solve Sudoku puzzles, starring the amazing Professor Thorsten Altenkirch.  However in the comments several people were asking for the code. The code was in the video but I think because the Prof was using Python with the Jupyter software maybe it wasn't totally clear what the whole code looked like.
